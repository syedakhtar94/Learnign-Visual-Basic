The files encrypt and decrypt in the "cypher" directory should be empty to observe the program's 
functionality correctly. 
The Program aslo takes the length of vector from the user and then takes the vector as integers.
Once the program is run we can see the "encrpyt.txt" file has the cypher text and the 
"decrypt.txt" file should have plain text generated from the decryption of cypher text.
The program can be run with other files by copying the text into the "book.txt" file or 
replacing the existing "book.txt" file with another file. (NOTE: the name will have to be changed
of the file to "book.txt" or change the name of file read into the program)
