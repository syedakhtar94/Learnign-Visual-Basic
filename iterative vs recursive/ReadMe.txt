StringCheck folder contains a program that checks using recursion and iteration if
a given word ends with any of "ing", "ed" or "e"

The other folder contains a program that evaluates a methimatical function by recursion.
The draw back being, that it causes the stack to overflow for values greater than 12. 
(hence it would have been interesting to solve it via iteration).
The iteration gives invalid results.
